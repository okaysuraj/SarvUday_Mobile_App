Question 1: Hello, I'm feeling anxious today
Answer 1: I understand you're feeling anxious. Can you tell me more about what's causing these feelings?

Question 2: I have a big presentation at work tomorrow
Answer 2: Work presentations can definitely cause anxiety. Have you prepared for it? Sometimes breaking down the preparation into smaller steps can help reduce anxiety.

Question 3: Yes, I've prepared but I'm still worried about forgetting something
Answer 3: It's natural to have those concerns. Consider doing a practice run or creating a simple checklist of key points. Remember, being well-prepared as you are is already a great step.
